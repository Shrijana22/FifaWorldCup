# Data can be examined by four ways # Describing Distributions
# SHAPE
# CENTER
# SPREAD AND
# OUTLIERS
# Shape of distribution
# This distribution is skewed to the right therefore this is right-tailed distribution.
# CENTER:The data seems to be centered around 120.
# SPREAD:From looking at the histogram, we can approximate the smallest observation (min), and the largest observation (max),
# So here the range is from 70 to 171 and thus approximate the range of the number of Goals Scored is 171-70=101.
#OUTLIERS:Outliers are observations that fall outside the overall pattern.So after looking at the boxplot there are no Outliers.
